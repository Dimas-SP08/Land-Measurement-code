## Features
- Mid thread validation (top, mid, bottom input)
- Calculate elevation & height difference automation
- Distance input between points
- Automatic status check (RISE or FALL)
- Export result to Excel .xlsx 
- Neatly formatted table output in terminal

## How It Works
1. User enters number of points, initial AMSL elevation and distance between each points.
2. For each point pair:
   - Input backsight and foresight using thread readings
   - Mid-thread is validated automatically
   - Elevation difference is calculated
   - Status is shown (RISE/FALL)
